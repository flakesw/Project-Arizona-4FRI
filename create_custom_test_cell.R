# create one-cell landscape with specified characteristics
# This script will write a one-cell raster with the provided values,
# allowing for flexible creation of one-cell test landscapes to evaluate
# different initial communities, input raster values, etc.

# at the moment, the script doesn't touch the NECN_scenario.txt script
# so you'll have to check that the names match what's written in the scenario

# Future features should include:
# create a new directory each time the script is run (optionally)
# create a new NECN_succession.txt, species traits, etc (optionally)
# allow for custom climate to be set

library("raster")
library("tidyverse")


# this script needs there to be an NECN_succession script, a climate file,
# and a scenario script
# in the working directory. Then you can either keep everything in one directory
# or make a subdirectory to put the new model files (new_folder == TRUE). 
# The script will make all the files in that folder, copy over your succession
# file and your scenario file, and create a batchfile to run the new model.
